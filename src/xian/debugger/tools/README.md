# Xian Debugger Tools

This directory contains diagnostic and analysis tools for the Xian state divergence debugger.

## üîß Startup Diagnostic Tool

**File:** `startup_diagnostic.py`

Run this before starting your application to identify potential issues:

```bash
python src/xian/debugger/tools/startup_diagnostic.py
```

**What it checks:**
- Python version compatibility
- Required dependencies
- File system permissions
- Available memory
- Common syntax issues in contract code
- Debugger configuration

## üîç Crash Analysis Tool

**File:** `crash_analyzer.py`

Analyzes crash logs after your application has crashed:

```bash
python src/xian/debugger/tools/crash_analyzer.py [log_directory]
```

**What it analyzes:**
- Crash frequency and types
- Most common operations before crashes
- Exception patterns
- Recent crash details with stack traces
- Provides specific recommendations

## üöÄ Usage Workflow

### Before Starting Your Application:
```bash
# Run diagnostics to prevent crashes
python src/xian/debugger/tools/startup_diagnostic.py

# If all checks pass, start your application
python src/xian/xian_abci.py
```

### After a Crash:
```bash
# Analyze what went wrong
python src/xian/debugger/tools/crash_analyzer.py

# Check the debug logs for more details
ls -la debug_logs/
```

## üìä Understanding the Output

### Startup Diagnostics
- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks**: Everything is OK
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow warnings**: Issues that might cause problems
- ‚ùå **Red X marks**: Critical issues that will likely cause crashes

### Crash Analysis
- **Crash Types**: Signal vs Exception crashes
- **Operations**: What the app was doing when it crashed
- **Exception Types**: Specific Python exceptions
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions to fix the issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### SyntaxWarning: "is" with a literal
**Problem:** Contract code uses `is` with strings or numbers
**Solution:** Replace `is` with `==` for value comparisons

### Memory Issues
**Problem:** High memory usage or leaks
**Solution:** Check contract code for memory-intensive operations

### JSON Decode Failures
**Problem:** Invalid JSON in contract state
**Solution:** Validate JSON data before processing

### File Permission Errors
**Problem:** Cannot write to debug directories
**Solution:** Check directory permissions or run with appropriate privileges

## üìù Log Files

The debugger creates several log files:
- `debug_logs/crash_log.json` - Detailed crash information
- `debug_logs/debugger.log` - General debugger logs
- `debug_snapshots/` - State snapshots for analysis
- `debug_reports/` - Analysis reports

## üîÑ Integration with Main Application

The crash detector is automatically enabled when you run your application with the debugger. It will:

1. **Monitor for crashes** in real-time
2. **Log crash details** with context
3. **Track recent operations** for forensic analysis
4. **Detect resource leaks** before they cause crashes
5. **Provide actionable insights** for fixing issues

No additional configuration is needed - just run your application normally and the crash detection will be active.
